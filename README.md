# Mac Dev Tools Installer Builder

This is a quick set of scripts to automatically build a set of development
tools, which is normally included with Xcode. The resulting installer is for
people who for whatever reason don't want to install Apple's Xcode package.

Right now, you can get started by running 'build-all.sh' which will create a skeleton for Installer Builder.

This is still really incomplete, but if you're interested, try it out!
